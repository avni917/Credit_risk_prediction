# 💳 Credit Risk Classification using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

This project builds a machine learning model to predict a customer's **Credit Score** (**Poor**, **Standard**, or **Good**) using financial, banking, and credit-related information. It demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning workflow, including exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The objective is to classify customers into different credit score categories to help financial institutions assess creditworthiness and support informed lending decisions.
